# etchasketch

This is a 16x16 grid of div squares that allows the user to manipulate 
each individual square's color by hovering over it with the cursor. 
The user will have the option to control the color they change to or
have each square change to a random color.

Project is based on The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch project in the 
Javascript Basics section of their Web Development 101 course.
